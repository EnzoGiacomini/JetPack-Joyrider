# JetPack-Joyrider
An attempt and self-challenge to recreate a classic mobile game. The game has only the basic mechanics.
Visually, isn't very loyal to the original game and that's because it was pretty difficult to find the original sprite.
However, the simple mechanic of random types of guns is in the game.
The script "MapManager" is the manager of the difficulty. It controls the randomness and the mechanics like:
- Horizontal Laser Spawn - which spawns and takes a little time to start so the player can escape.
- Missile - Spawns an alert of incoming missile and a few seconds after, it fires a missile.
- Bombs - Spawns randomly bombs, with a chance of spawning multiple bombs.
- Vertical Laser - This one, has more than one type.
There are more scripts, like:
- HUDManager - its name explains itself.
- Menu - responsible for the menu mechanics.
- PlayerScript - Controls the player mechanics and stats.
- SaveManager - Just saves the highest score.
- Miscellaneous

Some ideas for the future:
- add sound
- add bosses
- add infinity mode and story mode

thank you for your attention.
