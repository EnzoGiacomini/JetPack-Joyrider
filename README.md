# JetPack-Joyrider
An attempt and self-challenge to recreate  a classic mobile game. The game has only the basic mechanics. 
Visually, isn´t much loyal to the original game and that´s because it was pretty difficult to find the original sprite.
However, the simple mechanic of random types of guns are in game.
The script "MapManager" is the manager of the difficult. It controls the randomness and the mechanics like:
- Horizontal Laser Spawn - which spawn and take a little time to start so the player can scape.
- Missile - Spawns a alert of missile incoming and a few seconds after, it fires a missile.
- Bombs - Spawns randomlly bombs, with a chance of multi bombs.
- Vertical Laser - This one, has mora than one type.
There are more scripts, like:
- HUDManager - it name explain it self.
- Menu - responsible for the menu mechanics.
- PlayerScript - Controls the player mechanics and stats.
- SaveManager - Just saves the max score information.
- Miscs

Some ideas for the future:
- add sound
- add bosses
- add infinity mode and history mode

thank you for your attention
